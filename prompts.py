summarize_medical_webpage_prompt = """
You are a medical information specialist tasked with summarizing webpage content for medical symptom analysis and patient care recommendations. 
Your goal is to extract medically relevant information that can help inform symptom analysis, possible conditions, treatment options, and patient care guidance.

Here is the raw content of the medical webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Medical Context:
<medical_context>
Current patient symptoms: {symptoms}
Possible conditions being considered: {conditions}
Medical focus area: {focus_area}
</medical_context>

Guidelines for medical summarization:

1. **Clinical Information**: Extract symptoms, diagnostic criteria, treatment options, and prognosis information.
2. **Evidence-Based Content**: Prioritize information from medical journals, health organizations, and clinical studies.
3. **Patient Safety**: Include warnings, contraindications, emergency signs, and when to seek immediate care.
4. **Treatment Details**: Preserve medication names, dosages, treatment protocols, and therapy recommendations.
5. **Differential Diagnosis**: Highlight information that helps distinguish between similar conditions.
6. **Risk Factors**: Include demographic, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors mentioned.
7. **Reliable Sources**: Note if content is from medical institutions, peer-reviewed sources, or clinical guidelines.
8. **Current Guidelines**: Focus on recent medical consensus and updated treatment protocols.

Content Types to Prioritize:

- **Medical Journal Articles**: Extract methodology, patient populations, clinical findings, and conclusions.
- **Clinical Guidelines**: Preserve diagnostic criteria, treatment algorithms, and care protocols.
- **Health Organization Content**: Include recommendations from WHO, CDC, medical associations.
- **Patient Education Materials**: Extract clear explanations of conditions, treatments, and self-care.
- **Drug Information**: Include indications, contraindications, side effects, and interactions.

Output format:

```json
{{
    "medical_summary": "Comprehensive medical summary focusing on clinical relevance, diagnostic information, treatment options, and patient care guidance",
    "key_clinical_excerpts": "Important clinical quotes, diagnostic criteria, treatment recommendations, safety warnings, and expert medical opinions - up to 5 key excerpts",
    "relevance_to_symptoms": "Brief explanation of how this information relates to the current patient symptoms and conditions being considered",
    "reliability_assessment": "Assessment of source credibility (peer-reviewed, clinical guideline, patient education, etc.)"

Examples:

Example 1 (Clinical Study):
```json
{{
   "medical_summary": "A randomized controlled trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine studied 1,247 patients with acute chest pain. The study found that high-sensitivity troponin testing combined with clinical assessment reduced unnecessary hospitalizations by 23% while maintaining 99.5% sensitivity for myocardial infarction detection. Patients with troponin levels below 5 ng/L and low clinical risk scores were safely discharged with 30-day follow-up.",
   "key_clinical_excerpts": "High-sensitivity troponin below 5 ng/L combined with low HEART score effectively rules out acute MI, stated lead researcher Dr. Sarah Chen. The protocol reduced ED length of stay by average 2.3 hours without compromising patient safety. Patients should return immediately if chest pain worsens or radiates to arm or jaw, the study guidelines recommend.",
   "relevance_to_symptoms": "Directly relevant for chest pain evaluation and risk stratification protocols",
   "reliability_assessment": "High reliability - peer-reviewed study in major medical journal with large sample size"
}}
```

Example 2 (Treatment Guidelines):
```json
{{
   "medical_summary": "Updated American Heart Association guidelines for acute coronary syndrome management recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin 81mg daily plus clopidogrel 75mg daily for minimum 12 months post-stent placement. Guidelines emphasize early risk stratification using TIMI or GRACE scores, with high-risk patients requiring invasive strategy within 24 hours.",
   "key_clinical_excerpts": "All patients with NSTEMI should receive DAPT unless contraindicated by bleeding risk, per AHA guidelines. Early invasive strategy is recommended for GRACE score >140 or dynamic ECG changes. Contraindications include active bleeding, severe anemia (Hgb <7), or planned surgery within 5 days.",
   "relevance_to_symptoms": "Essential for acute chest pain management and post-cardiac event care",
   "reliability_assessment": "Highest reliability - official clinical guidelines from major cardiology organization"

Focus on information that directly supports clinical decision-making and patient safety.
